This is my first website that I created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little JS. 
I am happy to have started this jourey. 
This is a museum website working model multi page webiste with minimal animation. 
The blog section is empty because I thought of integrating it's control with wordpress CMS. So, I am looking for its integration.
So, here I am. Looking forward to making this into a complte dynamic website as I learn new concepts.
Thanks for paying a visit. I hope you liked it.
